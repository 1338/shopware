# Processor pattern of cart 

## Introduction
The processor pattern is the access point which allows to define at which point of calculation a specified task has to be executed.
For example the cart doesn't know at which time a product or voucher has to be calculated, this is task of the ProductProcessor and the VoucherProcessor.

## Register processor
Cart processors are registered via the symfony di container tag named `cart.processor`.
To define the order of the calculation queue, the tag supports the `priority` attribute:
```xml
<service id="cart.product.processor" class="Shopware\CartBridge\Product\ProductProcessor">
    <tag name="cart.processor" priority="1000" />
</service>
```
A high `priority` implies an early invocation of the processor. The `priority` defaults to `0`.
Currently the following processors are registered.

| priority | service id | class | task |
| -------- | ---------- | ----- | ---- |
| 1000 | cart.product.processor | Shopware\CartBridge\Product\ProductProcessor  |  handle products which added to the cart by customer  |
| 800 | cart.voucher.processor | Shopware\CartBridge\Voucher\VoucherProcessor | handle vouchers which added to the cart by customer |
| 600 | dynamic |  |  |
| 400 | cart.delivery.separator_processor | Shopware\Cart\Delivery\DeliverySeparatorProcessor  | separates the different deliverable line items into deliveries |
| 200 | cart.delivery.calculator_processor | Shopware\Cart\Delivery\DeliveryCalculatorProcessor | calculates all deliveries which were created |

## How a processor (should) work
A processor should only handle simple tasks like the filtering of its dedicated line items or deliveries of a cart. Further logic and calculation (delivery seperation, line item calculation) should be encapsulated in seperate services.

A simple processor could look like below:
```php
<?php

class ProductProcessor implements CartProcessorInterface
{
    const TYPE_PRODUCT = 'product';

    /**
     * @var ProductCalculator
     */
    private $calculator;

    public function process(
        Cart $cart,
        ProcessorCart $processorCart,
        StructCollection $dataCollection,
        ShopContext $context
    ): void {

        $collection = $cart->getLineItems()->filterType(self::TYPE_PRODUCT);
        if ($collection->count() === 0) {
            return;
        }

        $products = $this->calculator->calculate($collection, $context, $dataCollection);
        $processorCart->getCalculatedLineItems()->fill($products->getElements());
    }
}
```
